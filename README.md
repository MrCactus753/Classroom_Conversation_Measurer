# convo_measurer
A short program that I made to track the relation between the talking parts of students and teachers during class. It's not perfect by far, but I found it to be quite useful.

# HOW TO USE
1. Download the file with which you want to work (.py or .exe)
2. Run the file on your computer
3. To initialize the timer, type start into the main menue of the application
  1. The timer starts as soon as the ENTER-key is pressed
5. To mark the end of a speaking interval, simply enter the corrosponding letter for the person who's interval just ended and press the ENTER-key. (eg. if the teacher begins the lesson with a 15 min monologue, you can enter d, and the interval will be logged as soon as you press ENTER)
6. Should you accidentally press a wrong key (anything other than a,s,d or q) the program will simply ignore it.
7. To end the recording, simply enter q and confirm. The program will then ask you to give a classroom in which the hospitation took place.
8. The program terminates automatically. Afterwards the gathered data will be saved in the same directory as the program.
### IMPORTANT
Right now the program does NOT feature a mechanism to revert faulty entries, so I would reccomend you to take care.
